Reasons to evacuate during a Category 1 Hurricane: 

- Protecting personal safety: Category 1 hurricanes can rapidly escalate, posing risks to personal safety due to the potential for damaging infrastructure and causing dangerous flooding. 
- Access to emergency services: As the hurricane progresses, it may become increasingly difficult for emergency services to reach those who have chosen to stay behind. 

Reasons to not evacuate during a Category 1 Hurricane: 

- Home protection: Staying behind allows me to protect my property and potentially minimize damage caused by the hurricane. 
- Care for a dependent: My mother, a long-term care patient, is safer staying in the local hospital, which is designed to withstand such conditions and has emergency plans in place. 
- Objective assessment of risk: Current local conditions might suggest it is safe to stay put, especially when considering up-to-date atmospheric, oceanic, and hurricane-specific conditions. 
- Cost considerations: Evacuation incurs financial burdens, such as transportation, accommodation, and meals, which might be unaffordable. 
- Continuity: Staying put allows for the continuity of social and occupational life, potentially reducing the physical and mental stress associated with evacuation. 

Given the reasons for and against evacuation in the context of this Category 1 hurricane, I will base my decision on the specific circumstances. If the severity of the storm is expected to increase significantly or the current conditions are already threatening, I will evacuate. If, however, conditions are manageable and are not expected to worsen, I will make the choice to stay put.
