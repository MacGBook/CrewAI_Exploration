Reasons to not evacuate during a Category 1 Hurricane: 

1. Home Protection: Staying behind would allow you to protect your property and minimise damage caused by torrential rain, flooding, and powerful winds. 

2. Long-term care patient: My mother is a long-term care patient at the local hospital. Typically, hospitals are designed to withstand such conditions and have emergency plans in place. Her safety and medical needs would be better attended to at the hospital in the city.

3. Objective Assessment of Risk: Current and local conditions might be assessed as safe enough to stay. Updated atmospheric, oceanic, and hurricane-specific conditions could inform such an assessment.

4. Cost Factors: Evacuation comes with financial costs including transportation, accommodation, meals, and other unexpected expenses which may not be feasible.

5. Continuity: Social and occupational life can be maintained by staying put, given the situation does not worsen. This would reduce the physical and mental stress associated with evacuation.

Taking into account both the reasons for and against evacuation in the context of the current Category 1 hurricane, the decision to evacuate or not will largely depend on the situation. Given I prioritize the safety of my family and my mother's medical needs, I decide to evacuate if the forecast predicts a further increase in severity or if the current conditions pose a significant risk. If circumstances are under control while assuming the situation will not worsen, I decide not to evacuate.
