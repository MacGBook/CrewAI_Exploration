Here are my reasons for considering evacuation:

1. **Threat to Life:** This is one of the most significant storms to ever hit the Gulf Coast. If I stay, I would put my life and those of my family members in extreme danger. 

2. **Risk of Flooding:** The risk of flooding is particularly high during this storm. I run the risk of being trapped by the encroaching waters, with the potential of losing my home to water damage. 

3. **Inability to Access Medical Services:** Emergency facilities such as hospitals are being evacuated. My mother being a long-term patient, it's paramount to consider her safety and well-being during this evacuation.

4. **Loss of Basic Services:** Utilities like electricity, water and sewage systems will most likely be unavailable, making survival even more challenging. 

5. **Ease the Recovery Process:** If we evacuate, it would help the rescue teams in their recovery efforts.

Here are the reasons against evacuation:

1. **Homeowner Concerns:** Leaving my property behind feels wrong. There is a real possibility of looting and damage over which I'll have no control.

2. **Family on Medical Support:** My mother's medical condition worries me. Moving her from the hospital and finding a similar level of care elsewhere might be difficult or impossible.

3. **Potential Job Implications:** I would likely have to abandon my job, and job security is a real concern.

4. **Loss of Valuables:** Valuables and sentimental items that cannot be transported could be lost forever. 

5. **Uncertainty of Return:** The uncertainty about when and in what condition we would be able to return also weighs heavily on my mind.


Despite these considerations against evacuation, the safety of my family and I overrides all other concerns. Under harsh scrutiny against the unpredictable force of nature that is Hurricane Katrina, my home, my job, and my material possessions all lose their significance. I realize now that lives cannot be replaced, houses can be. Therefore, I have made my resolution.

**Final Decision:** To evacuate, prioritizing our lives over the material possessions and the complications that we will undoubtedly face when we return.
